# Task 1 – Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

## Objective
To implement a Caesar Cipher program that encrypts and decrypts text using a user-defined shift value.

## Tools Used
- Python 3

## Description
The Caesar Cipher shifts each alphabetic character by a fixed number of positions.
Encryption shifts characters forward, and decryption shifts them backward.

## How to Run
1. Run the file using: python caesar.py
2. Enter the message
3. Enter the shift value
4. Choose encrypt or decrypt

## Sample Output
Encryption:
Yashu → Bdvkx

Decryption:
Bdvkx → Yashu
